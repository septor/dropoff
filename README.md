# Dropoff

Some background, so you understand why this exists:

My place of work has an attentance policy that allows up to 8 occurrences (termination on the 9th). Each occurrence drops off exactly 6 months after it's accrued. For every leave early (working more than half your shift, but less than the complete shift) or tardy (late up to 2 hours, everything after is considered absent) you get half an occurrence. Every absence is one occurrence. They recently made it possible for us to check on these items outselves, but it's less than perfect and only reflects occurrences after they are managed.

This requires, at least personally, a way to track times I've been absent or left early for whatever reason. This way I can also keep track of these items whereever I go and not only while I'm at work. Plus, I'll easily see when my next occurrence drops off.


## Why publish this? It seems so generalized?

Is it? I don't know. Yeah the number of occurrences we're allowed is stupid high, but I can't imagine my place of work is the only one with this type of attendance system. If it is, oh well!

## Configuration

Yes I am making certain things configurable. Here's what:

* Point value - You can configure how many points an absences, leave early, and a tardy are worth.
* Total allowed points - You can configure how many points you can accrue before you're unemployed.
* Rolling period - You can define the amount of time that has to pass before an occurrence drops off.

## No one is going to use this but you!

That's cool. You can still read the code, plus every coding project teaches me something!

## Can I contribute with my attendance policy?

I'm not sure, throw up an issue. I currently have no interest in expanding this in any other direction but I'm not closed off to the possibility.
