# Dropoff

Dropoff does (or will do) a few things:

* Tracks your total active attendance occurrences.
* Tracks when an occurrence will drop off.
* .. more later!


## ...what?

My place of work has a rolling six-month attendance policy. We are allowed a certain number of occurrences. Each occurrence drops off exactly 6 months after it is activated.

I am writing this mostly for my personal use, but will attempt to keep it as non-myworkplace-specific as I can. Here's a list of things that I hope to allow for configuration:

* The period in which occurrences drop off. Default is 6 months.
* Total allowed occurrences.
* How many points an absence, tardy, and leave early count as. Defaults are 1, .5, and .5 respectively.
